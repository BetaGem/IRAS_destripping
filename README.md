# IRAS_destripping
A python realization of the IRAS image destripping algorithm described in [Miville-DeschÃªnes &amp; Marc-Antoine (2005)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005ApJS..157..302M) (Section 3.2)

> The ISSA plates have relatively strong stripes that are related to the scanning on the sky. We describe in this part our destriping algorithm that reduces significantly the amplitude of those stripes.

**Illustration of the destripping process:** (also shown in the notebook)
